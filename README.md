### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Juan JosÃ© GonzÃ¡lez and I'm a PHP developer with more than 10 years of experience. A long time ago, I put my focus on WordPress and WooCommerce and nowadays I'm specialized in them.

You probably reached my GitHub profile looking for a bit of code and the projects I contribute to. So feel free to take a look.

**Disclaimer:** Let you know I work full-time developing [WooCommerce extensions](https://woocommerce.com/vendor/themesquad) that are sold in the official marketplace and whose lines of code are not public. But sometimes I release some pieces of them that I consider can be useful to the community.

### Blog & Writing

Apart from coding, I also maintain a blog at [juagonala.com](https://juagonala.com). Here is where I share my thoughts, knowledge, and experiences working with WordPress and WooCommerce. You can also find tutorials and fragments of code too.

### Social profiles

You can also find me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juan-jose-gonzalez-alanis/).
